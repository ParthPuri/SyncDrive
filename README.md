# SyncDrive

**Signal-Aware Navigation and Speed Optimization System**

> Drive slower. Stop less. Arrive faster.

SyncDrive is a signal-aware GPS prototype that tells a driver *when to leave* and *what speed to maintain* so they pass through every traffic signal on green — eliminating red-light wait time entirely. The result: a lower speed with zero stops beats a faster speed with multiple stops.

**Core proof:**

| Strategy | Speed | Drive time | Wait time | **Total** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Normal GPS | 50 km/h | 1.7 min | 2.1 min | **3.8 min** |
| SyncDrive  | 32 km/h | 2.6 min | 0 min   | **2.6 min** ✅ |

## How It Works

### The Green Wave Concept

Traffic engineers use *green waves* — timing signals along a corridor so a vehicle at a specific speed hits all greens. SyncDrive reverses this for the individual driver: instead of the city timing lights for a fixed speed, the driver adjusts their speed to match whatever wave is currently running.

### Algorithm

```
For each speed in [25, 28, 30, 32, 35, 38, 40, 42, 45] km/h:
  For each departure offset in 0..25 min (step 15 s):
    dep = arrivalTime - driveTime - offset
    Simulate each signal:
      phase = (dep + timeToSignal + elapsed) % cycle
      if red: elapsed += waitUntilGreen(signal, phase)
    score = totalTime - 0.5 * greensHit   ← minimise
```

The `elapsed` accumulation is critical: each red stop shifts all subsequent signal arrival times, so missing it gives wrong results.

### Normal GPS comparison

Uses the **same departure time** as SyncDrive but drives at 50 km/h, hitting signals at uncontrolled phases and accumulating real wait time — a direct apples-to-apples comparison.
